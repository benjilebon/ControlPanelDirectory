# ControlPanelDirectory

A simple Batch File that creates a Folder on the Desktop containing every control panel's option

This is done by creating an actual folder using mkdir with a specific GUID that references the 'Root Control Panel', an invisible folder containing all control panel's option that exists for search implementation purpose

This exploit has been found in 2007 as the "God Mode" or the "Master Control Panel"
